paperArt

A mobile application that allows users to create an account and share their paper creations(origami models) with the community. 
It shows a list of categories with a short description, and for each category, a list of the users's origami models. 
Categories can only be added by administrators. 
A user can be notified when new items are added in a specific category and can modify/delete his own models. 
Also, each item can be given a rating by other users and a current ranking will be shown when selecting an item.
